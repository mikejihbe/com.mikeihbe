### Navigation
On the documentation page, the sections you specify in gitdoc.json will be listed on the right
as the main navigation links, you can have subsections too. Any h3(###) lines you include in
in your documentation files will be added to the subsections under the main section link. They
will be hidden until you hover over the main section link or have clicked the section link.

### Headers
You can use any size headers you want, but it is adivised to use h3(###) and smaller, anything
bigger than h3(e.g. h2) is usually too big for the default layout.

### Scrolling
When you scroll down the page the navigation will follow you if the screen is big enough for the
navigation to fit on the right side, otherwise it sits at the top.
