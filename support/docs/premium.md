### Premium repositories
Once you get premium, the plan you selected delegates the number of premium repositories you're
allowed to have. Premium repositories have many features not available without a premium plan.

### Personally hosted repositories
The premium repositories you select are allowed to be hosted on their own domains, you can choose
a domain in your `support/gitdoc.json` file. Just add a `domain` field with your domain, and
point your domain at our site, and it will automatically load your repo.

### Custom CSS
You're premium repos can have custom layouts through CSS. Once you add a premium repo, simply create
the file `support/styles.css` and refresh your repo, when the page refreshes you'll be able to
see the custom CSS in action.

### Standard Git repos
Standard Git repositories from non Github servers are supported after you have a premium plan.
To add a standard repo to your account, go to your settings page and click on the "Standard Repos"
tab, then fill out the form to add your repo. After that it can be removed, updated, and refreshed
as expected.
